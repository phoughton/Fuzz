fuzzutf8
JULY/2011

This tool aims to make it easier to produce randomised utf8 codepoints.

It's for command line use, developed on mac os x, should work on Windows and *nix.

For use with Ruby versions 1.9+, (Earlier versions of Ruby do not have reliable utf8 handling.) 

This script needs more testing... ;-)

# fuzzutf8

The fuzzutf8 tool aims to make it easier to produce randomised utf8 codepoints. It can be tailored to produce only ASCII or a wider selection of characters/code points.

It also provides the ability to output a human readable list of the actual codepoint IDs outputed, for repeatability and debuging.

It's for command line use, developed on mac os x, should work on Windows and *nix.

For use with Ruby versions 1.9+, (Earlier versions of Ruby do not have reliable utf8 handling.)
